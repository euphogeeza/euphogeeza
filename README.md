- 👋 Hi, I’m @euphogeeza
- 👀 I’m interested in PHP web development (back and front end). Music -I am currently the Principle euphonium player for Snowdown Colliery Welfare Brass Band. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Laravel
- My current / near future projects are: 
  - Re-writing the Snowdown Band's website using Laravel (currently on Wordpress where all custom funcationality is burried in a Wordpress plugin that I wrote (probably badly!)
  - Re-writing the Kent Scouts International Jamboree Booting Portal (again is currently a Wordpress base with a custom plugin doing all the heavy lifting to a new site utilising Laravel).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me progress as a developer. About to be made redundant (laid off) from my current employment so looking at pastures new.
- 📫 How to reach me @euphogeeza on Twitter or ritchiefraser.co.uk
